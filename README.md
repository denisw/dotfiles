# @denisw's dotfiles

This repository uses the configuration files of various tools I use. My tool of choice for managing them is [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/):

    git clone https://github.com/denisw/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
    
    # Create symlinks to the dotfiles in "emacs" in my home directory
    stow emacs

Feel free to reuse the files in this repository however you like.
